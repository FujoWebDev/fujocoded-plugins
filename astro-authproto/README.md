# `@fujocoded/authproto`

<!-- banner -->

ATproto authentication for your Astro site. Free and Easyâ„¢!

<!-- badges -->

## What is `@fujocoded/authproto`?

`@fujocoded/authproto` allows your visitors to log into your website using their
account on any ATproto services (like Bluesky) or in technical terms their PDS!

Under the hood, `@fujocoded/authproto` adds OAuth authentication to your site
through
[`@atproto/oauth-client-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-node),
then uses Astro's session adapters (based on
[`@unjs/unstorage`](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage)) to store your visitor's
credentials.

## What's included in `@fujocoded/authproto`?

In this package, you'll find:

- `@fujocoded/authproto`, an Astro integration that:
  - Adds the authentication routes you need
  - Lets you easily access the DID and handle of a logged in user, if any
- `@fujocoded/authproto/components`, which includes:
  - A basic login/logout component to get started quickly
- `@fujocoded/authproto/helpers`,
  - `getPdsAgent` etc.?
  - `friendsOnly` function (or similar)

## What can you do with `@fujocoded/authproto`?

- **Let visitors log in to your site** with their ATproto account (such as a Bluesky
  account). With this, you can:
  - Build private, friends-only spaces and pages
  - Gate certain content from the public
- **Read data from other ATproto services**, including [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/),
  [Streamplace](https://stream.place/), [Teal.FM](https://teal.fm/), and more!
  Among the many uses, you can:
  - Show a list of your favorite [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) posts, or
    embed [Leaflet publications](https://leaflet.pub/)
  - Tell everyone about the music you love by listing
    your [Rocksky](https://rocksky.app/) stats
- **Create, update, and delete data** on ATproto services, both existing ones or
  _your own_!
  - Post on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) from your own website
  - Build [guestbooks](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/lexicon-guestbook/) that
    others on ATproto can interact with
  - Make your _own_ ATproto app that shares data with the rest of the network

# Getting started

## Pre-requisites

- Node
- NPM/pnpm/yarn
- Terminal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `deno` requires a workaround due to a CJS/ESM import issue within
> `@atproto/oauth-client-node`.

// TODO: we can move this in a details tab

Requires some familiarity with Astro, but if you want to jump in head first:

1. Install Astro by [following their official
   tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard).
   Once you do, [set your Astro site to server
   mode](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#server-mode).
2. Install [any of the
   adapters](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#server-adapters).

- You can start out with
  [Node](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/), since
  that's a widely supported runtime.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install @fujocoded/authproto
```

```bash
npx astro add @fujocoded/authproto
```

4. Add the integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file, like this:

// TODO: add a note that this requires a server and an adapter that supports //
some type of storage...? I'm unsure how it works on e.g. netlify for the //
various session handlers

// TODO: we might also want to make sure people do not set certain adapters //
or even better just disallow the ones they shouldn't.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
+ import node from "@astrojs/node";
+ import authproto from "@fujocoded/authproto";

export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
+ adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }), // ... or whichever adapter you're using!
+ integrations: [
+   authproto({
+     // config options here
+   }),
+ ],
});
```

> [!TIP] You can take a look at all the [possible configuration options
> below](#configuration-options).

5. Add the `<Login />` component to your site, like this:

```
// src/pages/index.astro
---
import { Login } from "@fujocoded/authproto/components";
---

<Login />
```

> [!TIP] You might run into a naming collision issue if you also have a page
> named `login`. You can fix this by replacing `{ Login }` with `{ Login as
LoginComponent }`.

It'll look like a plain form:

<!-- screenshot -->

To make a page only visible to logged in users:

```ts
// src/pages/secret.astro
---
const loggedInUser = Astro.locals.loggedInUser;

// if they're not logged in, send them back to a login page
if (!loggedInUser) {
  return Astro.redirect("/login");
}
---

<h1>Secret</h1>
<p>This is a secret page that only authenticated users can see!</p>
```

<!-- screenshots here -->

... And you've got authentication working on your Astro site!

# Okay how do I _actually_ do stuff with this?

Check out the example sites included:

- [`__example__`](./__example__) shows you how to set up a login flow.
- `__example_status__` has some examples of creating new records on a PDS.

# Configuration options

- `applicationName`, required. The name of your application. For example, you
  can set this to `"My personal guestbook"`!
- `applicationDomain`, required. It should be a domain that your site is on, or
  you can just put in `"localhost:4321"` for now.
- `defaultDevUser`, optional. The default handle that gets filled out in the
  `<Login />` component during development.
- `driver`, optional. The driver used to store data about OAuth sessions. This
  takes Astro's [session driver
  options](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#sessiondriver).
  You can also set this with `name: "astro:db"` to utilize [Astro's DB
  integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/) for
  OAuth sessions. This will set up tables for sessions in your database.
  - NOTE: The default driver is `memory`. This is fine for development, but it's
    recommended that you switch to a more reliable solution for production.
  - NOTE: Using either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` will result in a
    ["Session storage could not be initialized."
    error](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/errors/session-storage-init-error/)
    (and is considered insecure for handling sessions anyway). Consider other
    options, like a database.
- `scopes`, optional. By default, only the `"atproto"` scope is added. This
  scope is included with any other scope that's enabled. See [ATproto's
  documentation for OAuth
  scopes](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth#authorization-scopes).
  - `email`: boolean, optional. Only used to identify you by email. Does nothing
    to a PDS.
  - `genericData`: boolean, optional. Allows you to read/write data to a user's
    PDS, but does not access BlueSky direct messages.
  - `directMessages`: boolean, optional. Allows you to access BlueSky direct
    messages for a user's account. Requires `genericData` to be enabled.
  - `additionalScopes`: array, optional. This is used in case you need to expand
    permissions to include other services. This should be an array of strings,
    like this: `["scope1", "scope2"]`
