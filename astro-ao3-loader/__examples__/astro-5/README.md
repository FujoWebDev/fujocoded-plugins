# Astro AO3 Loader Example

This example features `@fujocoded/astro-ao3-loader` in action.

Inside, you'll see (among others) the following folders and files:

```text
/
├─ ...
├─ src/
│  └─ content/
│     └── ao3/
│         └── series.yaml
│         └── works.yaml
│     └── config.ts
│  └─ pages/
│     └── index.astro
└─ package.json
```

Explore them at your leisure and open an issue if you have any question.



## Commands

These commands are Astro's built-in functionality and should be run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
